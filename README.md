# ImageToSound
## Idea
The main idea is to analyze the input image and convert it into sound or mash-up with another audio file if needed
##  MVP Scope
As a user, I want to select an image on the computer and convert it to an audio representation
## How it works
Based on MVP Scope, we can specify next behaviors:
* User can select an image on the computer
* User can select duration (5-30 sec.) of the audio track (before saving) in which the converted image will be recorded
* User can save converted image into .wav file
* User can select an audio file from computer
* User can create a mash-up from a selected image and another audio file
* User can adjust the brightness of the image relative to the audio file

## Technological stack
* SpringBoot as a skeleton framework
* JavaFX Weaver starter
* JavaFX for GUI
